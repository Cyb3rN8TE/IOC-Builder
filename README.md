**PowerShell script that refangs or defangs IP addresses, domains and URLs in a spreadsheet (.CSV) containing Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**

**Introduction**

IOC Builder is a versatile PowerShell script designed to streamline the management of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) contained within CSV files. This script simplifies the process of defanging or refanging these IOCs, ensuring they are well-prepared for further analysis or integration with other tools.

**What does it do?**
1) Imports raw .CSV that the user selects
2) Searches the spreadsheet for all IP addresses, domains and URLs
3) Refangs or defangs any values that are IP addresses, domains or URLs
5) Saves the resulting .CSV file with a name and location of the users selection.
